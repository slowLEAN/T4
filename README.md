In this task, we built a binary classifier using logistic regression on a medical dataset. First, we loaded the data and cleaned it by removing any non-predictive or empty columns. We selected the features needed for prediction and converted the target variable into a binary format suitable for classification. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, we handled missing values by replacing them with the average of each feature. To improve model performance, we standardized the features so they all had a similar scale. We then trained a logistic regression model on the prepared data and evaluated its effectiveness using metrics like the confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC score. Finally, we visualized the modelâ€™s prediction quality with an ROC curve, which helps assess how well the classifier distinguishes between the two classes. This approach ensures the model is robust and reliable for making binary decisions in medical diagnosis.
